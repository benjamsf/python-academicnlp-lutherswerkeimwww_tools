# Luther Scripts
## A Latin NLP project
MIT-License, (c) Benjam Br√∂ijer (u:benjamsf)

## What
Collection of Python scripts to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) on Latin source text supplied by the user. Support for source text from Luther's Werke im WWW, a Weimarer Ausgabe -rendition offered by ProQuest, LLC, but you could use these for any Latin text you specifically provide yourself in UTF-8 .txt-files.

## Why
I noticed that while the tools to do the actual hard work are present and available, I found no ready scripts to do the kind of a trivial work to tokenize and analyze a Latin text that is not from eg. LatinCorpus by CLTK itself. So I made these for my thesis work, and made them public in case anybody else needs to do similar tasks. 

## How
I update the documentation as I grow the tools. By now there are capabilities to prepare text from Luther's Werke im WWW, and to tokenize words. I intend to make this library easy to install and use.
